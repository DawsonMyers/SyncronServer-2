Move librxtxSerial to the same directory as runnable jar. create sym link for .so so that it's name does not contain the version numbers.
 
 
This targets the native file

Sym link serial port so that it will be recognized by Rxtx:
	ln -s /dev/ttyACM0 /dev/ttyS10
	
Run at cli:
	cd [dir of jar]
	java -Djava.library.path=".:./librxtxSerial.so" -jar mar4.jar "/dev/ttyS10"
